<h3>3D trainstation</h3>
<hr>

In this project I've created a 3D layout of a trainstaition.

The layout contains static objects, passive and controllable animations, special lightings and shadows.
I've also used special texture for basically every part of the station to make it look somewhat more real.
The train and the rails were originally created in blender, but after importing the models they were also modified.

The project uses the following technologies: javascript, html, three.js library

In orded to make the program work on your own setup, you have to install the three.js library and configure its relative path in the project.

For the sake of simplicity I've created a short video.
